# Commute Estimator

This project allows users to get an estimate for what thier daily commute to work would be. It asks the user to input their home address, work address and time at work. Once submitted the data is sent to Google Maps Directions API, which returns the directions, as well as an estimate for the commute with and without traffic.

## Goals

My personal goals in completing this project were to continue to improve my understanding of Javascript and web development in general. I wanted to work with APIs, updating UIs and use asynchronis functions all with vanilla Javascript. Additionally, I wanted to actually use this site to help aid decision making while considering moving to a new residence.

## Running the tests

Coming soon.

## TODO

* Figure out more eloquent async calls to Google Maps Directions API
* Add tests
* Add commute check for +/- 30 mintes and alert user if commute is drastically shorter

## Deployment
